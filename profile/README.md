# Ihsan Agile

**Embedding Islamic Values in Agile Delivery**

Ihsan Agile overlays existing Agile methods (Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, SAFe) with principles drawn from the Qur'an and Sunnah, turning everyday work into a form of ʿibādah (worship) through niyyah (intention), iḥsān (excellence with God-consciousness), and shūrā (consultation).

Ihsan Agile is an open, non-commercial framework stewarded by its founding author. It is shared under the CC BY-SA licence and developed through published principles, empirical practice, and scholarly engagement.

## 📖 The Ihsan Agile Guide (Version 1.1)

The Ihsan Agile Guide provides a framework for Muslim workplaces, Islamic institutions, fintech companies, and development teams to align their delivery practices with Islamic values.

**[Download the Guide](https://github.com/ihsan-agile/ihsan-agile-guide) and [or through Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17794837)** | **[Visit ihsanagile.org](https://ihsanagile.org)**

### What's Inside

- **Three Pillars**: Niyyah (Intention), Iḥsān (Excellence), Maṣlaḥah (Public Good)
- **Five Core Principles**: Taqwā, Stewardship, Shūrā, Service & Justice, Continuous Growth
- **The Ihsan Agile Facilitator Role**: A companion-coach who helps teams operationalize Islamic values
- **Practical Overlays**: Concrete practices that embed into Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe ceremonies
- **Real Scenarios**: Worked examples from Islamic fintech and community tech

## 🔎 Who Is This For?

- Muslim workplaces and enterprises seeking to align delivery with maqāṣid al-sharīʿah
- Islamic institutions (mosques, schools, charities, NGOs) serving the ummah
- Islamic fintech and tech companies building for Muslim communities
- Muslim software teams within larger organizations
- Professionals who wish to practice Agile as tazkiyah (purification and growth)

## 🤝 We Need Early Adopters

**Version 1.1 is ready. Now we need your practice.**

Ihsan Agile is designed to be tried in small ways, within the Agile approaches teams already use. 

Ihsan Agile is built on a simple Islamic premise:
accountability begins with intention, not scale.

If you’re part of a Muslim-led team, you can start with a single practice for a single sprint. Use what works for you and experiment.

For example:

- a short niyyah check-in at Sprint Planning
(“Why are we building this? Who benefits?”)

- a brief muḥāsabah reflection in Retrospectives
(“Where did we act with iḥsān? Where did we fall short?”)

- adding ethical completeness, justice, transparency, stewardship, to your Definition of Done

Ihsan Agile calls for no new role hires and demands no methodology change. It overlays onto Agile ways of working already used (Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe).

In Islamic ethics, responsibility (amānah) is borne through intention and honesty, even when systems are complex and outcomes appear beneficial.

Teams can stop after a single practice, or continue only insofar as reflection remains helpful.

The aim is not to perfect delivery, but to remain answerable for how and why we build, even under pressure.

If you’re curious, you’re welcome to try one small practice and see what it surfaces.

## 🌟 Why Ihsan Agile?

We're witnessing an exciting moment in Muslim tech and Islamic enterprise. Organizations articulate inspiring Islamic principles. The **Muslim Tech Manifesto** energizes developers. Islamic fintech and tech startups multiply. *Ma Sha Allah. Alhamdulillah!* There is energy, conviction, and vision.

Many successful Muslim-led teams maintain Islamic values through strong culture, individual judgment, and shared understanding, especially using established Agile methods like Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe.

### From Principles to Practice

As teams grow and evolve, natural questions emerge:

- How do we translate Islamic principles into the daily Agile ceremonies our teams already use?
- How do we enrich sprint planning, retrospectives, and stakeholder reviews with our values?
- How do we make values systematic, teachable, and sustainable as we scale?

Consider everyday decisions teams navigate:

- A development team balancing testing thoroughness with delivery deadlines
- A Product Owner weighing priorities: conversion metrics or user wellbeing?
- A designer choosing between engagement optimization and transparent interactions
- A team managing technical debt and future sustainability

These decisions touch on justice (ʿadl), trust and stewardship (amānah), transparency, and care for stakeholders. They're not "Shariah decisions" requiring formal governance, yet they shape whether organizations actively embody Islamic values or gradually drift.

### Making Values Operational

Ihsan Agile provides a practical approach by offering:

- **The Ihsan Agile Facilitator (IAF) role**: A companion-coach who helps teams embed ethical consciousness into workflows
- **Practical overlays**: Enrich existing Agile ceremonies (adding 2-10 minutes, not replacing what works)
- **Five Core Principles**: Rooted in Qur'an and Sunnah that operationalize values in daily practice

The framework overlays onto Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, or Scrumban—enriching sprint planning with niyyah check-ins, retrospectives with muhāsabah reflection, and definition of done with ethical completeness.

### Work as Khidmah (Service-Worship)

> "Whoever relieves a Muslim of some worldly distress, Allah will relieve him of some of the distress of the Day of Resurrection..." (Sunan Ibn Mājah 225)

When developers write accessible code, they relieve users from distress. When teams prioritize features that help vulnerable communities, they engage in ʿibādah. Ihsan Agile transforms customer-centricity into: *Does this work relieve distress? Does it serve maṣlaḥah (public good)?*
